Functions of a Stock Market A stock market primarily serves the following main functions: Fair Dealing in Securities Transactions Depending on the standard rules of supply and demand, the stock exchange needs to ensure that all interested market participants have instant access to data for all buy and sell orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. Additionally, it should also perform efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders.4 For example, there may be three buyers who have placed orders for buying Microsoft shares at $100, $105, and $110, and there may be four sellers who are willing to sell Microsoft shares at $110, $112, $115, and $120. The exchange (through automated trading systems) needs to ensure that the best buy and the best sell are matched, which in this case is at $110 for the given quantity of trade. Efficient Price Discovery Stock markets need to support an efficient mechanism for price discovery, which refers to the act of deciding the proper price of a security and is usually performed by assessing market supply and demand and other factors associated with the transactions. Let’s say a U.S.-based software company is trading at a price of $100 and has a market capitalization of $5 billion. A news item comes in that the European Union (EU) regulator has imposed a $2 billion fine on the company, which essentially means that 40% of the company’s value may be wiped out. While the stock market may have imposed a trading price range of $90 and $110 on the company’s share price, it should efficiently change the permissible trading price limit to accommodate for the possible changes in the share price, or else shareholders may struggle to trade at a fair price. Liquidity Maintenance While getting the number of buyers and sellers for a particular financial security are out of control for the stock market, it needs to ensure that whoever is qualified and willing to trade gets instant access to place orders that should get executed at a fair price.
