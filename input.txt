In a nutshell, stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets.3 As a primary market, the stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the common public for the first time through the process of an initial public offering (IPO). This activity helps companies raise necessary capital from investors. It essentially means that a company divides itself into a number of shares (for example, 20 million shares) and sells a part of those shares (say, 5 million shares) to the public at a price (for instance, $10 per share).3 To facilitate this process, a company needs a marketplace where these shares can be sold. This marketplace is provided by the stock market. If everything goes according to plan, then the company will successfully sell the 5 million shares at a price of $10 per share and collect $50 million worth of funds. Investors will get the company shares, which they can expect to hold for their preferred duration, in anticipation of rising in share price and any potential income in the form of dividend payments. The stock exchange acts as a facilitator for this capital-raising process and receives a fee for its services from the company and its financial partners.
